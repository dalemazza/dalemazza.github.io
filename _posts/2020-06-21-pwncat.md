## Do you hate when you Ctrl+c in a reverse shell and lose it? I did until I found Pwncat!

Recently I was doing a machine on Hack the box, I managed to get a reverse shell on the machine but it was flaky and kept crashing on me. This got me thinking that surely someone somewhere has made a script to fix this problem?  

After some google fu I stumbled across this [github](https://github.com/cytopia/pwncat) repo. It had everything I had ever dreamed about in one tool! Some highlights include:  

* Port Scanning
* Self-injecting reverse shell
* Bind shell
* Reverse shell
* Port forwarding
* Protection from Ctrl+c !!!!!!
* Evade IPS and Firewall
* Plus much more!

I had to try this tool! So I cloned the repo and put it to the test. I quickly wanted to try the `--self-inject` function out. To my surprise it caught the reverse shell but did not work after after upgrading the shell to TTY.
