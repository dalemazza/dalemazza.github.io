## About me

Hi I'm Dale Marriott 27 from England. I have been using Computers my whole life. I am aspiring to become a Pentester and gain the OSCP along my way!

This blog will be following my journey from scrub to OSCP!. This blog will contain a collection of things I have found along my journey from HTB write ups to cool tools I have found.
